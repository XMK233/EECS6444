* I recommend that all the members will have a separate folder to store their own stuff. And then we keep modifying this file to say `I have done xxx part.`
* Plan: (if finished, use ~~delete line~~ to mark them) 
    * **Minke**: ~~extract java from cvs files; consider more conditions for regular expression~~; The results is in [Minke/Extract_Java_Code/Extract_Java_Code.zip](https://github.com/XMK233/EECS6444/blob/master/Minke/Extract_Java_Code/Extract_Java_Code.zip) 
    * **Kim**: test the metrics calculation tools; 
    * **Garg**: use bugID and bugzilla file to get the post- and pre-release bug list;
